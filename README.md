# Deep Guitar Amplifier 

A little project to practice Tensorflow/Keras. I use deep learning to simulate a guitar amplifier following the approach published in [Wright et al., 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/3/766/htm). 

As done by Wright and colleagues, I use two different neural network architectures (recurrent and convolutional) for black-box modelling of a guitar amplifier.

The dataset for this project can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e09uhp3syjnyrmc/wav.rar?dl=0).
